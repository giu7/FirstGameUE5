# Cube Invaders

This project is my very first approach to Unreal Engine 5.

Move your Player with WASD and shoot enemies with SPACE.

This game is a 3D Space Invaders version with basic game components:
- single level
- auto-spawning player when game starts
- pseudo-random auto-spawning enemies
- score widget
- restart interaction
